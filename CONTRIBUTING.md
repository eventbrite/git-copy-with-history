## How to develop with the script
After upates to the script you will need to run the `make install` command to override your local copy with the latest. 

Beyond that, I have just continued to run the plugin over and over until it does what I want. 

Which means a lot of `git reset --hard <sha>` and `rm -rf <destination_path>`

Thanks for contributing!
